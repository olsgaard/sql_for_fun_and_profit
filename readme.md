# SQL for fun & profit

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebook setup to run on [`xeus-sqlite`-kernel](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-sqlite), so that each cell is its own query against a sqlite database.

This is a relatively easy way to write notes and cheatsheets on SQL usage. This started with me wanting to solve the [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) but has exapnded to other notebooks.

# Installation

If you already have conda installed, you can setup an environment with a SQL kernel by simply running

```shell
sh setup.sh
```
